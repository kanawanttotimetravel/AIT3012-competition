# AIT3012: Competition

## Disclaimer 
Due to the time constraint, we haven't been able to derive a functional pipeline. Our codebase are purely run on Jupyter notebook, and hosted on Kaggle, a cloud-based site for Jupyter notebook. As such, most of the code are hard-coded, and likely unable to run without specific editing. The file `eegnet-features-full-pipeline.ipynb` contain the whole pipeline, and can be run with the conda configuration
